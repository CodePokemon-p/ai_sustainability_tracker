## Project Overview

The **AI Sustainability Tracker** is a comprehensive tool designed for textile factories and eco-conscious brands to **track, analyze, and optimize environmental impact**. The platform monitors key sustainability metrics such as CO₂ emissions, water consumption, energy usage, waste generation, and pollutants.

It also integrates **AI-driven analytics**, predictive alerts, and interactive tools for improved decision-making and sustainable production practices.

## Key Features

### Tracker Tool
- Track CO₂ emissions, water consumption, energy consumption, waste, and pollutants.
- Provides **professional analysis** with primary driver, risk, and actionable recommendations.
- Supports multiple product types: Recycled Poly, Organic Cotton, Synthetic Blend, Microfiber.
- Multi-line, concise dashboard analytics.
- Run via  (python app.py)

### AI Pattern Layout Optimizer
- Uses a **Genetic Algorithm (GA)** and **Computer Vision (CV)** to optimize fabric layouts.
- Maximizes utilization (80–90%) and reduces fabric waste.
- Generates **DXF files** for production.
-  Run via (python pattern_app.py)

### Report Analyzer
- Upload CSV or PDF reports to analyze environmental metrics.
- Generates automated analytics with clear sustainability insights.
- Run via `Python analyzer.py`.

### MessageAlert
- Allows managers to send messages/alerts to employees or brand members.
- Messages appear in the **Alert Center** for real-time communication.
- Run via `Python app.py` in the respective Flask folder.

### EcoBoot AI Chatbot
- Interactive AI chatbot for discussing sustainability practices.
- Provides guidance and answers questions related to environmental impact.
- Run backend with: uvicorn eco_bot:app --reload --port 8000
